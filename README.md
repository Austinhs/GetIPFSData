# Getting started
- Run `npm install`
- Go to index.js modify `BASE_URI`, `START_ID`, `END_ID`, to your scrapping needs
- Modify `CORES` to your CPU cores
- You may need to modify `MAGIC_NUMBER` if you get a TCP connection issue, but I recommend leaving it as is first
- To execute the script: `node index.js`
